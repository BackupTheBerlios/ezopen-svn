Brief;

Just my personal thoughts :)

* tabs are expanded to 2 spaces
* white space is your friend! (ie. use ( 1 + 1 ) * 2, rather than (1+1)*2).
* on the same note, the following are used;

if ( boolean )
{
  // ...
}
else
{
  // ...
}

while ( boolean )
{
  // ...
}

for ( a ; b ; c )
{
  // ...
}

etc.! It all helps code readability.
