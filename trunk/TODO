* remove all EZClient code (the two classes CEzFlashBase and CEzFlashFujistu)
* refactor 'main' code
* introduce *real* command line option checking
* automate ROM patching 'on the fly' when burning to cart.
* automated ROM padding (IIRC ROM size must lie on a power of 2 boundary)
* percentage progress indicator when erasing ROM blocks
* ROM blocks are 64k but current erasing treats them as 32k (and hence erases
  twice as many as needed).
* saver read/write support
* saver fixes (possibly ROM hack required)
* cartridge header dumping (ie. display contents)
* formatting cartridge
